**What is ThreeSixtyVoice?**

ThreeSixtyVoice is a Wordpress plugin developed from the initial ideas behind the [360Voice](http://www.360voice.com/ "360voice.com") plugin by David Larrabee of [Squidpunch.com](http://www.squidpunch.com "squidpunch.com"). I have rewritten large segments of the code with validation and also load times in mind. Essentially it uses the APIs from 360Voice.com to display an assortment of data in a widget, or even in your template.

There is nothing wrong with Davidâ€™s plugin, it functions as required, even if it is rather messy and does not validate correctly. I am by no means trying to belittle his work, but offer an alternative.

**Features**

    * Display your badges
    * Display your blog entries
    * Display your favorites (most played)
    * Display your position in various 360V leaderboards
    * Display your 100% complete games
    * Widget enabled

All items are able to be toggled on and off, with the number of blog entries and also favorites that is displayed configurable.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `wp-threesixtyvoice.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
